CREATING FINETUNE DATASET
To create instruction versions of the models and develop the
best finetuning datasets, we have compiled various datasets
and merged shared collections. Finding a suitable dataset for
finetuning has been one of the focal points of our research.
Original datasets have been created using various sources,
including open-source platforms, contributions from individuals, and data generated by GPT-4 [7]. Initially, four primary
datasets were established. Subsequently, through cleaning and
various combinations, new datasets have been derived. Here
are the names and features of the mentioned primary datasets:
